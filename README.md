# django_tutorial
This is a simple project to start understanding Django. I've been following this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1intZyhXDU <br>
In any case, this is just a simple base and I will continue with another proyect to learn more about CRUD, auth and users permissions.


To start running, open shell and type: <br>

source .venv/bin/activate
python manage.py runserver <br>
It should be running in :8000.
